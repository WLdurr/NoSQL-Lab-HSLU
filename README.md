# NoSQL-Lab-HSLU

This repository is just to upload the HSLU NoSQL Lab project which has been done with a data set about World of Warcraft items. The data was accessed via other public Github repositories, which provide the necessary data for non-commercial use.

If the .ipynb file can't be displayed correctly, make sure to download it.
